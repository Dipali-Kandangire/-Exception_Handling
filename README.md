#Exception-Handling

This repository illustrates how to implement exception handling in Java through the Thread and Runnable interface. It features a real-time banking system example where concurrent transactions (deposits and withdrawals) demonstrate handling exceptions like InsufficientFundsException effectively. Dive into the code to see how to manage errors gracefully in a multithreaded environment!
